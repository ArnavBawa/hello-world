Here is where I will write a summary of what I learned on: https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/what-is-github/

Github is a service provided by a company. It is a cloud based service on a website that helps peoplpe develop and manage code using two key ideas: version control and Git. Yes, Git is different than Github. Git is a distributed version control system, meaning that "the entire codebase and history is available on every developerâ€™s computer, which allows for easy branching and merging." The terms branching and merging fall under the concept of version control. 

Branching is where a developer copies the source code and makes their own changes to it without impacting the original code. Merging is when the developer decides their version of the code is working and wants to include it in the original source code. 

This article essentially explains the interface on Github for those functions.
